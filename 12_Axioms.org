* Axioms and Computation
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

We have seen that the version of the Calculus of Inductive
Constructions that has been implemented in Lean includes Pi types, and
inductive types, and a nested hierarchy of universes with an
impredicative, proof-irrelevant =Prop= at the bottom. In this chapter,
we consider extensions of the CIC with additional axioms and
rules. Extending a foundational system in such a way is often
convenient; it can make it possible to prove more theorems, as well as
make it easier to prove theorems that could have been proved
otherwise. But there can negative consequences of adding additional
axioms, consequences which may go beyond concerns about their
correctness. In particular, the use of axioms bears on the
computational content of definitions and theorems, in ways we will
explore here.

Lean is designed to support both computational and classical
reasoning. Users that are so inclined can stick to a "computationally
pure" fragment, which guarantees that closed expressions in the system
evaluate to canonical normal forms. In particular, any closed
computationally pure expression of type =ℕ=,  for example,
denoting a natural number will reduce to a numeral.

To support classical reasoning, Lean's standard library defines
one choice axiom, which is justified on a set-theoretic
interpretation of type theory. In the standard library, the law of the
excluded middle is a consequence of this axiom.
The library also imports two semi-constructive (or mildly classical) axioms,
propositional extensionality and quotients. These
are used, for example, to develop a theories of sets and finite sets.
Even some computationally inclined users may also wish to use the law
of the excluded middle to reason about computation. Below we will
describe the effects that these axioms have on computation aspects of
the system.

However, the classical choice axiom (also known as the Hilbert operator) is entirely
inimical to a computational interpretation of the system,
which magically produces "data" from a proposition
asserting its existence. Its use is essential to some classical
constructions, and users can import it when needed. But expressions
that depend on this construction lose their computational content, and
in Lean we are required to mark such definitions as =noncomputable= to
flag that fact.

** Historical and Philosophical Context

For most of its history, mathematics was essentially computational:
geometry dealt with constructions of geometric objects, algebra was
concerned with algorithmic solutions to systems of equations, and
analysis provided means to compute the future behavior of systems
evolving over time. From the proof of a theorem to the effect that
"for every =x=, there is a =y= such that ..." is was generally
straightforward to extract an algorithm to compute such a =y= given
=x=.

In the nineteenth century, however, increases in the complexity of
mathematical arguments pushed mathematicians to develop new styles of
reasoning that suppress algorithmic information and invoke
descriptions of mathematical objects that abstract away the details of
how those objects are represented. The goal was to obtain a powerful
"conceptual" understanding without getting bogged down in
computational details, but this had the effect of admitting
mathematical theorems that are simply /false/ on a direct
computational reading.

There is still fairly uniform agreement today that computation is
important to mathematics. But there are different views as to how best
to address computational concerns. From a /constructive/ point of
view, it is a mistake to separate mathematics from its computational
roots; every meaningful mathematical theorem should have a direct
computational interpretation. From a /classical/ point of view, it is
more fruitful to maintain a separation of concerns: we can use one
language and body of methods to write computer programs, while
maintaining the freedom to use a nonconstructive theories and methods
to reason about them. Lean is designed to support both of these
approaches. Core parts of the library are developed constructively,
but the system also provides support for carrying out classical
mathematical reasoning.

Computationally, the "purest" part of dependent type theory avoids the
use of =Prop= entirely. Inductive types and Pi types can be viewed as
data types, and terms of these types can be "evaluated" by applying
reduction rules until no more rules can be applied. In principle, any
closed term (that is, term with no free variables) of type =ℕ= should
evaluate to a numeral, =succ (succ (succ ... 0))=.

Introducing a proof-irrelevant =Prop= and marking theorems irreducible
represents a first step towards separation of concerns. The intention
is that elements of a type =P : Prop= should play no role in
computation, and so the particular construction of a term =t : P= is
"irrelevant" in that sense. One can still define computational objects
the incorporate elements of type =Prop=; the point is that these
elements can help us reason about the effects of the computation, but
can be ignored when we extract "code" from the term. Elements of type
=Prop= are not entirely innocuous, however. They include equations =s
= t : A= for any type =A=, and such equations can be used as casts, to
type check terms. Below, we will see examples of how such casts can
block computation in the system. However, computation is still
possible under an evaluation scheme that erases propositional content,
ignore intermediate typing constraints, and reduces terms until they
reach a normal form. Current plans for Lean include the development of
a fast evaluator along these lines.

Having adopted a proof-irrelevant =Prop=, one might consider it
legitimate to use, for example, the law of the
excluded middle, governing propositions. Of course, this, too, can
block computation, but it does not block fast evaluation as described
above.  From a constructive point of view, the most objectionable
classical axioms are "choice axioms" that allow us to extract "data"
from any existential proposition, completely erasing the distinction
between the proof-irrelevant and data-relevant parts of the
theory. These are discussed in Section [[#Choice_Axioms][Choice Axioms]] below.

** Propositional Extensionality

Propositional extensionality is the following axiom:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
namespace hide

-- BEGIN
axiom propext {a b : Prop} : (a ↔ b) → a = b
-- END

end hide
#+END_SRC
It asserts that when two propositions imply one another, they are
actually equal. This is consistent with set-theoretic
interpretations in which any element =a : Prop= is either empty or the
singleton set ={*}=, for some distinguished element =*=. The axiom has
the the effect that equivalent propositions can be substituted for one
another in any context:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
namespace hide

axiom propext {a b : Prop} : (a ↔ b) → a = b

-- BEGIN
section
  open eq.ops
  variables a b c d e : Prop
  variable P : Prop → Prop

  example (H : a ↔ b) : (c ∧ a ∧ d → e) ↔ (c ∧ b ∧ d → e) :=
  propext H ▸ !iff.refl

  example (H : a ↔ b) (H1 : P a) : P b :=
  propext H ▸ H1
end
-- END

end hide
#+END_SRC
The first example could be proved more laboriously without =propext=
using the fact that the propositional connectives respect
propositional equivalence. The second example represents a more
essential use of =propext=. In fact, it is equivalent to =propext=
itself, a fact which we encourage you to prove.

** Function Extensionality

Similar to propositional extensionality, function extensionality
asserts that any two functions of type =Π x : A, B x= that agree on
all their inputs are equal.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
namespace hide

-- BEGIN
check @funext
-- ∀ {A : Type} {B : A → Type} {f₁ f₂ : Π x : A, B x}, (∀ x, f₁ x = f₂ x) → f₁ = f₂
-- END
end hide
#+END_SRC
From a classical, set-theoretic perspective,
this is exactly what it means for two functions to be
equal. This is known as an "extensional" view of functions. From a
constructive perspective, however, it is sometimes more natural to
think of functions as algorithms, or computer programs, that are
presented in some explicit way. It is certainly the case that two
computer programs can compute the same answer for every input despite
the fact that they are syntactically quite different. In much the same
way, you might want to maintain a view of functions that does not
force you to identify two functions that have the same input / output
behavior. This is known as an "intensional" view of
functions.

In fact, function extensionality follows from the existence of
quotients, which we describe in the next section. In the Lean standard
library, therefore, =funext= is thus [[https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/init/funext.lean][proved from the quotient
construction]].

Suppose that for =X : Type= we define the ~set X := X → Prop~ to
denote the type of subsets of =X=, essentially identifying subsets
with predicates. By combining =funext= and =propext=, we obtain an
extensional theory of such sets:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import logic
open eq.ops

namespace hide

-- BEGIN
definition set (X : Type) := X → Prop

namespace set

variable {X : Type}

definition mem [reducible] (x : X) (a : set X) := a x
notation e ∈ a := mem e a

theorem setext {a b : set X} (H : ∀ x, x ∈ a ↔ x ∈ b) : a = b :=
funext (take x, propext (H x))

end set
-- END
end hide
#+END_SRC
We can then proceed to define the empty set and set intersection, for
example, and prove set identities:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import standard
import logic
open eq.ops

namespace hide

definition set (X : Type) := X → Prop

namespace set

variable {X : Type}

definition mem [reducible] (x : X) (a : set X) := a x
notation e ∈ a := mem e a

theorem setext {a b : set X} (H : ∀ x, x ∈ a ↔ x ∈ b) : a = b :=
funext (take x, propext (H x))

-- BEGIN
definition empty [reducible] : set X := λ x, false
notation `∅` := empty

definition inter [reducible] (a b : set X) : set X := λ x, x ∈ a ∧ x ∈ b
notation a ∩ b := inter a b

theorem inter_self (a : set X) : a ∩ a = a :=
setext (take x, !and_self)

theorem inter_empty (a : set X) : a ∩ ∅ = ∅ :=
setext (take x, !and_false)

theorem empty_inter (a : set X) : ∅ ∩ a = ∅ :=
setext (take x, !false_and)

theorem inter.comm (a b : set X) : a ∩ b = b ∩ a :=
setext (take x, !and.comm)
-- END

end set
end hide
#+END_SRC

The following is an example of how function extensionality blocks
computation inside the Lean kernel.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

definition f₁ (x : ℕ) := x
definition f₂ (x : ℕ) := 0 + x

theorem feq : f₁ = f₂ := funext (take x, eq.subst !zero_add rfl)
check eq.rec (0 : ℕ) feq    -- ℕ
eval eq.rec (0 : ℕ) feq     -- eq.rec 0 feq
#+END_SRC
First, we show that the two functions =f₁= and =f₂= are equal using
function extensionality, and then we "cast" =0= of type =ℕ= by
replacing =f₁= by =f₂= in the type. Of course, the cast is vacuous,
because =ℕ= does not depend on =f₁=. But that is enough to do the
damage: under the computational rules of the system, we now have a
closed term of =ℕ= that does not reduce to a numeral. In this case, we
may be tempted to "reduce" the expression to =0=. But in nontrivial
examples, eliminating cast changes the type of the term, which might
make an ambient expression type incorrect.

In the next section, we will exhibit a similar example with the
quotient construction.  Current research programs, including work on
/observational type theory/ and /cubical type theory/, aim to extend
type theory in ways that permit reductions for casts involving
function extensionality, quotients, and more. But the solutions are
not so clear cut, and the rules of Lean's underlying calculus do not
sanction such reductions.

In a sense, however, a cast does not change the "meaning" of an
expression. Rather, it is a mechanism to reason about the expression's
type. Given an appropriate semantics, it then makes sense to reduce
terms in ways that preserve their meaning, ignoring the intermediate
bookkeeping needed to make the reductions type correct. In that case,
adding new axioms in =Prop= does not matter; by proof irrelevance, an
expression in =Prop= carries no information, and can be safely ignored
by the reduction procedures.

** Quotients

Let =A= be any type, and let =R= be an equivalence relation on =A=. It
is mathematically common to form the "quotient" =A / R=, that is, the
type of elements of =A= "modulo" =R=. Set theoretically, one can view
=A / R= as the set of equivalence classes of =A= modulo =R=. If =f : A
→ B= is any function that respects the equivalence relation in the
sense that for every =x y : A=, =R x y= implies =f x = f y=, then =f=
"lifts" to a function =f' : A / R → B= defined on each equivalence
class =[x]= by =f' [x] = f x=. Lean's standard library extends the
Calculus of Inductive Constructions with additional constants that
perform exactly these constructions, and installs this last equation
as a definitional reduction rule.

First, it is useful to define the notion of a /setoid/, which is
simply a type with an associated equivalence relation:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
namespace hide

-- BEGIN
structure setoid [class] (A : Type) :=
(r : A → A → Prop) (iseqv : equivalence r)

namespace setoid
  infix `≈` := setoid.r

  variable {A : Type}
  variable [s : setoid A]
  include s

  theorem refl (a : A) : a ≈ a :=
  and.elim_left (@setoid.iseqv A s) a

  theorem symm {a b : A} : a ≈ b → b ≈ a :=
  λ H, and.elim_left (and.elim_right (@setoid.iseqv A s)) a b H

  theorem trans {a b c : A} : a ≈ b → b ≈ c → a ≈ c :=
  λ H₁ H₂, and.elim_right (and.elim_right (@setoid.iseqv A s)) a b c H₁ H₂
end setoid
-- END

end hide
#+END_SRC
Given a type =A=, a relation =R= on =A=, and a proof =p= that =R= is
an equivalence relation, we can define =setoid.mk p= as an instance of
the setoid class. Lean's type class inference mechanism then allows us
to use the generic notation =≈= for =R=, and to use the generic theorems
=setoid.refl=, =setoid.symm=, =setoid.trans= to reason about =R=.

The quotient package consists of the following constructors:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
namespace hide

-- BEGIN
open setoid
constant quot.{l}   : Π {A : Type.{l}}, setoid A → Type.{l}

namespace quot
  constant mk        : Π {A : Type}   [s : setoid A], A → quot s
  notation `⟦`:max a `⟧`:0 := mk a

  constant sound     : Π {A : Type}   [s : setoid A] {a b : A}, a ≈ b → ⟦a⟧ = ⟦b⟧
  constant lift      : Π {A B : Type} [s : setoid A] (f : A → B), (∀ a b, a ≈ b → f a = f b) → quot s → B
  constant ind       : ∀ {A : Type}   [s : setoid A] {B : quot s → Prop}, (∀ a, B ⟦a⟧) → ∀ q, B q
end quot
-- END

end hide
#+END_SRC
For any type =A= with associated equivalence relation =R=, first we
declare a setoid instance =s= to associate =R= as "the" equivalence
relation on =A=. Once we do that, =quot s= denotes the quotient type
=A / R=, and given =a : A=, =⟦a⟧= denotes the "equivalence class" of
=a=. The meaning of constants =sound=, =lift=, and =ind= are
given by their types. In particular, =lift= is the function which
lifts a function =f : A → B= that respects the equivalence relation to
the function =lift f : quot s → B= which lifts =f= to =A / R=. After
declaring the constants associated with the quotient type, the library
file then calls an internal function, =init_quotient=, which installs
the reduction that simplifies =lift f ⟦a⟧= to =f a=.

To illustrate the use of quotients, let us define the type of ordered
pairs. In the standard library, =A × B= represents the Cartesian
product of the types =A= and =B=. We can view it as the type of pairs
=(a, b)= where =a : A= and =b : B=. We can use quotient types to
define the type of unordered pairs of type =A=. We can use the
notation ={a₁, a₂}= to represent the unordered pair containing =a₁=
and =a₂=.  Moreover, we want to be able to prove the equality ={a₁,
a₂} = {a₂, a₁}=.  We start this construction by defining a relation =p
~ q= on =A × A=.

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.prod

private definition eqv {A : Type} (p₁ p₂ : A × A) : Prop :=
(p₁.1 = p₂.1 ∧ p₁.2 = p₂.2) ∨ (p₁.1 = p₂.2 ∧ p₁.2 = p₂.1)

infix `~` := eqv
#+END_SRC

To make the proofs more compact, we open the namespaces =eq= and =or=.
Thus, we can write =symm=, =trans=, =inl= and =inr= instead of
=eq.symm=, =eq.trans=, =or.inl= and =or.inr= respectively.
We also define the notation =⟨H₁, H₂⟩= for =(and.intro H₁ H₂)=.

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open eq or

#+END_SRC

The next step is to prove that =eqv= is an equivalence relation, which
is to say, it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. We can prove
these three facts in a convenient and readable way by using dependent
pattern matching to perform case-analysis and break the hypotheses
into pieces that are then reassembled to produce the conclusion.

Now that we have proved that =eqv= is an equivalence relation, we can

To complete the example, given =a : A= and =u : uprod A=, we define
the proposition =a ∈ u= which should hold if =a= is one of the
elements of the unordered pair =u=.  First, we define a similar
proposition =mem_fn a u= on (ordered) pairs, then we show that
=mem_fn= respects the equivalence relation =eqv=, in the lemma
=mem_respects=.  This is an idiom that is used extensively in the Lean
standard library.

** Choice Axioms
:PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Choice_Axioms
:END:

The following axiom is used to support classical reasoning in Lean:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open subtype nonempty

namespace hide
-- BEGIN
axiom strong_indefinite_description {A : Type} (P : A → Prop) (H : nonempty A) :
  { x | (∃ y : A, P y) → P x}
-- END
end hide
#+END_SRC
This asserts that given any predicate =P= on a nonempty type =A=, we
can (magically) produce an element =x= with the property that if any
element of =A= satisfies =P=, then =x= does. In the presence of
classical logic, we could prove this from the slightly weaker axiom:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open subtype nonempty

namespace hide
-- BEGIN
axiom indefinite_description {A : Type} {P : A → Prop} (H : ∃ x, P x) :
  {x : A | P x}
-- END
end hide
#+END_SRC
This says that knowing that there is an element of =A= satisfying =P=
is enough to produce one. This axiom essentially undoes the separation
of data from propositions, because it allows us to extract a piece of
data --- an element of =A= satisfying =P= --- from the proposition
that such an element exists.

The axiom =strong_indefinite_description= is imported when you import
=logic.choice=. Separating the =x= asserted to exist by the
axiom from the property it satisfies allows us to define the Hilbert
epsilon function:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import logic.quantifiers

axiom strong_indefinite_description {A : Type} (P : A → Prop) (H : nonempty A) :

theorem epsilon_spec_aux {A : Type} (H : nonempty A) (P : A → Prop) (Hex : ∃ y, P y) :

theorem epsilon_spec {A : Type} {P : A → Prop} (Hex : ∃ y, P y) :
    P (@epsilon A (nonempty_of_exists Hex) P) :=
epsilon_spec_aux (nonempty_of_exists Hex) P Hex
-- END

end hide
#+END_SRC
Assuming the type =A= is nonempty, =epsilon P= returns an element of
=A=, with the property that if any element of =A= satisfies =P=,
=epsilon P= does. Notice that the definition is preceded by the
keyword =noncomputable=, to signal the fact that expressions depending
on this definition will not compute to canonical normal forms, even
under the more liberal evaluation scheme described above.

Just as =indefinite_description= is a weaker version of
=strong_indefinite_description=, the =some= operator is a weaker
version of the =epsilon= operator. It is sometimes easier to
use. Assuming =H : ∃ x, P x= is a proof that some element of =A=
satisfies =P=, =some H= denotes such an element.

In Section [[file:08_Building_Theories_and_Proofs.org::#Making_Auxiliary_Facts_Visible][Making Auxiliary Facts Visible]], we explained that, on some
occasions, it is necessary to use =assert= instead of =have= to put
auxiliary goals into the context so that the elaborator can find
them. This often comes up in connection to =epsilon= and =some=,
because these induce dependencies on elements of =Prop=. The following
examples illustrate some of the places where =assert= is needed. A
good rule of thumb is that if you are using =some= or =epsilon=, and
you are presented with a strange error message, trying changing =have=
to =assert=.

** Excluded Middle

The law of the excluded middle is the following
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open classical
namespace hide
-- BEGIN
check @em
-- ∀ (a : Prop), a ∨ ¬a
-- END
end hide
#+END_SRC
We can prove it using the choice axiom described in the previous section.
This is a consequence of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaconescu%27s_theorem][Diaconescu's theorem]]
which states that the axiom of choice is sufficient to
derive the law of excluded middle. More precisely, it shows that the
law excluded middle follows from =strong_indefinite_description=
(Hilbert's choice), =propext= (propositional extensionality) and
=funext= (function extensionality).
The standard library contains
[[https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/logic/choice.lean][this proof]], which we reproduce here.

First, we import the necessary axioms, fix a parameter, =p=, and
define two predicates =U= and =V=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
-- BEGIN
import logic.eq
open classical eq.ops

section
parameter  p : Prop

definition U (x : Prop) : Prop := x = true ∨ p
definition V (x : Prop) : Prop := x = false ∨ p
-- END

end
#+END_SRC
If =p= is true, then every element of =Prop= is in both =U= and
=V=. If =p= is false, then =U= is the singleton =true=, and =V= is the
singleton =false=.

Next, we use =epsilon= to choose an element from each of =U= and =V=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import logic.eq
open classical eq.ops

section
parameter  p : Prop

definition U (x : Prop) : Prop := x = true ∨ p
definition V (x : Prop) : Prop := x = false ∨ p

-- BEGIN
noncomputable definition u := epsilon U
noncomputable definition v := epsilon V

lemma u_def : U u :=
epsilon_spec (exists.intro true (or.inl rfl))

lemma v_def : V v :=
epsilon_spec (exists.intro false (or.inl rfl))
-- END

end
#+END_SRC
Each of =U= and =V= is a disjunction, so =u_def= and =v_def= represent
four cases. In one of these cases, =u = true= and =v = false=, and in
all the other cases, =p= is true. Thus we have:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import logic.eq
open classical eq.ops

section
parameter  p : Prop

definition U (x : Prop) : Prop := x = true ∨ p
definition V (x : Prop) : Prop := x = false ∨ p

noncomputable definition u := epsilon U
noncomputable definition v := epsilon V

lemma u_def : U u :=
epsilon_spec (exists.intro true (or.inl rfl))

lemma v_def : V v :=
epsilon_spec (exists.intro false (or.inl rfl))

-- BEGIN
lemma not_uv_or_p : ¬(u = v) ∨ p :=

  (assume Hut : u = true,

        or.inl Hne)
      (assume Hp : p, or.inr Hp))
  (assume Hp : p, or.inr Hp)
-- END

end
#+END_SRC
On the other hand, if =p= is true, then, by function extensionality
and propositional extensionality, =U= and =V= are equal. By the
definition of =u= and =v=, this implies that they are equal as well.

epsilon_spec (exists.intro true (or.inl rfl))

lemma not_uv_or_p : ¬(u = v) ∨ p :=
or.elim u_def
  (assume Hut : u = true,
    or.elim v_def
      (assume Hvf : v = false,
        have Hne : ¬(u = v), from Hvf⁻¹ ▸ Hut⁻¹ ▸ true_ne_false,
        or.inl Hne)
      (assume Hp : p, or.inr Hp))
  (assume Hp : p, or.inr Hp)

      propext (iff.intro Hl Hr)),
have H' : epsilon U = epsilon V, from Hpred ▸ rfl,
show u = v, from H'

Consequences of excluded middle include
double-negation elimination, proof by cases, and proof by
contradiction, all of which are described in Section [[file:03_Propositions_and_Proofs::#Classical_Logic][Classical Logic]].

The law of the excluded middle and propositional extensionality imply
propositional completeness:

** Propositional Decidability

Taken together, the law of the excluded middle and the axiom of indefinite description
imply that every proposition is decidable. The following is the
contained in =logic.choice=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open classical decidable inhabited nonempty

namespace hide

-- BEGIN
noncomputable definition decidable_inhabited [instance] (a : Prop) : inhabited (decidable a) :=

noncomputable definition prop_decidable [instance] (a : Prop) : decidable a :=
arbitrary (decidable a)
-- END

end hide
#+END_SRC
The definition =decidable_inhabited= uses the law of the excluded middle
to show that =decidable a= is inhabited for any =a=. It is marked as
an instance, and is silently used for for synthesizing the implicit
argument in =arbitrary (decidable a)=.

As an example, we use =some= to prove that if =f : A → B= is injective
and =A= is inhabited, then =f= has a left inverse. To define the left
inverse =linv=, we use the "dependent if-then-else" expression.
Recall that =if h : c then t else e= is notation for =dite c (λ h : c,
t) (λ h : ¬ c, e)=.  In the definition of =linv=, the
=strong_indefinite_description= is used twice: first, to show that =(∃
a : A, f a = b)= is "decidable", and then to choose an =a= such that
=f a = b=. From a classical point of view, =linv= is a function. From
a constructive point of view, it is unacceptable; since there is no
way to implement such a function in general, the construction is not
informative.

#+END_SRC

** Constructive Choice

In the standard library, we say a type =A= is =encodable= if there are
functions =f : A → nat= and =g : nat → option A= such that for all
=a : A=, =g (f a) = some a=. Here is the precise definition:

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
namespace hide
open option
-- BEGIN
structure encodable [class] (A : Type) :=
(encode : A → nat) (decode : nat → option A) (encodek : ∀ a, decode (encode a) = some a)
-- END

end hide
#+END_SRC

The standard library shows that =indefinite_description= axiom is
actually a theorem for any encodable type =A= and decidable predicate
=p : A → Prop=. It provides the following definition and theorem,
which are concrete realizations of =some= and =some_spec=,
respectively.

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.encodable
open encodable subtype
-- BEGIN
check @choose
-- choose : Π {A : Type} {p : A → Prop} [c : encodable A] [d : decidable_pred p], (∃ (x : A), p x) → A
check @choose_spec
-- choose_spec : ∀ {A : Type} {p : A → Prop} [c : encodable A] [d : decidable_pred p] (ex : ∃ (x : A), p x), p (choose ex)
-- END
#+END_SRC

The construction is straightforward: it finds =a : A= satisfying =p=
by enumerating the elements of =A= and testing whether they satisfy
=p= or not.  We can show that this search always terminates because we
have the assumption =∃ (x : A), p x=.

We can use this to provide a constructive version of the theorem
=has_left_inverse_of_injective=.  We remark this is not the only
possible version. The constructive version contains more hypotheses
than the constructive version. In Bishop's terminology, it avoids
"pseudo-generality."  Considering the classical construction, it is
clear that once we have =choose=, we can construct the left inverse as
long as we can decide whether =b= is in the image of a function =f : A
→ B=.

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.encodable

  parameter  [deqB : decidable_eq B]
  include inhA dex encB deqB

  definition finv : B → A :=
  λ b : B, if ex : (∃ a, f a = b) then choose ex else arbitrary A

  theorem has_left_inverse_of_injective : injective f → has_left_inverse f :=
  assume inj : ∀ a₁ a₂, f a₁ = f a₂ → a₁ = a₂,
  have is_linv : ∀ a, finv (f a) = a, from
    (take a,
      assert ex  : ∃ a₁, f a₁ = f a, from exists.intro a rfl,
      have   feq : f (choose ex) = f a, from !choose_spec,
      calc finv (f a) = choose ex :  dif_pos ex
               ...    = a         :  inj _ _ feq),
  exists.intro finv is_linv
end
#+END_SRC
The argument is essentially the same as the classical one; we have
simply replaced the classical =some= with the constructive choice
function =choose=, and added three extra hypotheses: =dex=, =encB= and
=deqB=. The first one makes sure we can decide whether a value =b= is
in the image of =f= or not, and the last two are needed to use
=choose=.

The standard library contains many =encodable= types and shows that
many types have decidable equality.  The hypothesis =dex= can be
satisfied in many cases. For example, it is trivially satisfied if =f=
is surjective. It is also satisfied whenever =A= is finite.

** Tracking used axioms

The Lean standard library contains only 3 axioms: =quot.sound=, =propext= and =strong_indefinite_description=.
Most of the library depends only on the first two.
The command =print axioms= displays all axioms that have been asserted/imported into the current logical context.
Similarly, the command =print axioms decl_name= prints all axioms the declaration =decl_name= depends on.

/IMPORTANT/: in the Lean web version, we erase the proof of most
theorems. The idea is to reduce the size of the file that must be
downloaded to run Lean on your web browser. So, the result of the
=print axioms= commands is not precise on the web version. Please use
the Lean native application if you are interested in using these
commands.
