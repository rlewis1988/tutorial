** Common Options

You can change an option by typing =set_option <option> <value>=. 
The =<option>= field supports TAB-completion. 
You can see an explanation of all options using =help options=.

** Attributes

These can generally be declared with a =definition= or =theorem=, or
using the =attribute= or =local attribute= commands. 

Example: =local attribute nat.add nat.mul [reducible]=.
#+BEGIN_SRC text
reducible       : unfold at any time during elaboration if necessary
quasireducible  : unfold during higher order unification, 
                  but not during type class resolution

** Proof Elements

*** Term Mode

#+BEGIN_SRC text
take, assume     : syntactic sugar for lambda
let              : introduce local definitions
have             : introduce auxiliary fact (opaque, in the body)
assert           : like "have", but visible to tactics
show             : make result type explicit
suffices         : show that the goal follows from this fact
obtain ..., from : destruct structures such as exists, sigma, ...
match ... with   : introduce proof or definition by cases
proof ... qed    : introduce a proof or definition block, elaborated separately
#+END_SRC

The keywords =have= and =assert= can be anonymous, which is to say, they can be used without
giving a label to the hypothesis. The corresponding element of the context can then be
referred to using the keyword =this= until another anonymous element is introduced, or by
enclosing the assertion in backticks. To avoid a syntactic ambiguity, the keyword =suppose= 
is used instead of =assume= to introduce an anonymous assumption.

One can also use anonymous binders (like =lambda=, =take=, =obtain=, etc.) by enclosing
the type in backticks, as in =Î» `nat`, `nat` + 1=. This introduces a variable of the given
type in the context with a hidden name.

*** Tactic Mode

At any point in a proof or definition you can switch to tactic mode and apply tactics to 
finish that part of the proof or definition

#+BEGIN_SRC text
begin ... end   : enter tactic mode, and blocking mechanism within tactic mode
{ ... }         : blocking mechanism within tactic mode
by ...          : enter tactic mode, can only execute a single tactic
begin+; by+     : normally entering tactic mode will make declarations in the local context 
                  given by "have"-expressions unavailable. Entering tactic mode with these
                  will make all declarations available
have            : as in term mode (enters term mode), but visible to tactics
assert          : as in term mode (stays in tactic mode)
show            : as in term mode (enters term mode)
match ... with  : as in term mode (enters term mode)
let             : introduce local fact (opaque, in the body)

** Sectioning Mechanisms

#+BEGIN_SRC text
namespace <id> ... end <id>  : begin / end namespace
section ... end              : begin / end section
section <id> .... end <id>   : begin / end section

variable (var : type)        : introduce variable where needed
variable {var : type}        : introduce implicit variable where needed
variable {{var : type}}      : introduce implicit variable where needed, 
                               which is not maximally inserted
variable [var : type]        : introduce class inference variable where needed
variable {var} (var) [var]   : change the bracket of an existing variable 
parameter                    : introduce variable, fixed within the section
include                      : include variable in subsequent definitions
omit                         : undo "include"
#+END_SRC

** Tactics

We say a tactic is more "aggressive" when it uses a more expensive (and complete) 
unification algorithm, and/or unfolds more aggressively definitions.

*** General tactics

#+BEGIN_SRC text
apply <expr>      : apply a theorem to the goal, create subgoals for non-dependent premises
fapply <expr>     : like apply, but create subgoals also for dependent premises that were 
                    not assigned by unification procedure
eapply <expr>     : like apply, but used for applying recursor-like definitions
exact <expr>      : apply and close goal, or fail
rexact <expr>     : relaxed (and more expensive) version of exact
                    (this will fully elaborate <expr> before trying to match it to the goal)
refine <expr>     : like exact, but creates subgoals for unresolved subgoals

intro <ids>       : introduce multiple variables or hypotheses
intros <ids>      : same as intro <ids>
intro             : let Lean choose a name
intros            : introduce variables as long as the goal reduces to a function type
                    and let Lean choose the names

rename <id> <id>  : rename a variable or hypothesis
generalize <expr> : generalize an expression
clear <ids>       : remove variables or hypotheses
revert <ids>      : move variables or hypotheses into the goal
assumption        : try to close a goal with something in the context
eassumption       : a more aggressive ("expensive") form of assumption

                        goal, and replace it with <expr>

krewrite              : using keyed rewriting, matches any subterm 
                        with the same head as the rewrite rule
xrewrite              : a more aggressive form of rewrite

subst <id>            : substitute a variable defined in the context, and clear hypothesis and 
                        variable
substvars             : substitute all variables in the context

** Unicode Symbols

This section lists some of the Unicode symbols that are used in the
Lean library, their ASCII equivalents, and the keystrokes that can be
used to enter them in the Emacs Lean mode.

*** Logical symbols

| Unicode | Ascii  | Emacs                   |
|---------+--------+-------------------------|
| true    |        |                         |

| â        | ~=     | =\ne=                   |

*** Types

| Î  | Pi    | =\Pi=                     |
| â | ->    | =\to=, =\r=, =\implies=   |
| Î£ | Sigma | =\S=, =\Sigma=            |
| Ã | prod  | =\times=                  |
| â | sum   | =\union=, =\u+=, =\uplus= |

| â | real  | =\real=                   |

When you open the namespaces =prod= and =sum=, you can use =*= and =+=
for the types =prod= and =sum= respectively. To avoid overwriting
notation, these have to have the same precedence as the arithmetic
operations. If you don't need to use notation for the arithmetic
operations, you can obtain lower-precedence versions by opening the
namespaces =low_precedence_times= and =low_precedence_plus=
respectively.
